# TewDew App
Thereâ€™s an overabundance of To-Do apps that are overcomplicated and clutter the User Interface. Very few of these apps can do it like https://teuxdeux.com/. The TeuxDeux app is a personal, minimal To-Do app that allows for easy weekly/daily task setting. My TewDew app is my attempt at recreating the TeuxDeux app using Angular.
